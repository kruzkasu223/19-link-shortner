# 19/27-link-shortner

This project is all about creating a custom URL shortener tool. I will use a
combination of front-end and back-end technologies to develop a web application
that allows users to create short URLs that redirect to their long-form
counterparts.

This will be a full stack project, will build frontend as well as api which can
be used independently. I will use [Create T3 App](https://create.t3.gg/) to
initiate the project and will use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/),
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) and for
styling [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) with
[daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) with
[PlanetScale's MySQL database](https://planetscale.com/).
